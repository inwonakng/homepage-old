This was my submission to Algorand foundation's Mega Ace Hackathon.
Similar to [clean my web](/blog/clean-my-web), this project is a data repository -- this time not focused on spam URLs -- that can receive submissions from anyone with an Algorand wallet.
I was originally planning on using Reach.sh to implement my smart contract, but was struggling through their documentation and wasn't able to get a full grasp of what I needed to do.
Then I learned about the [algokit](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-cli) environment (beaker, algosdk) on the day of the Hackathon, which I decided to change tracks to.
This project got second place in RPI's local competition.
