This was my submission to Algorand foundation's Mega Ace Hackathon.

Similar to clean my web, this project is a data repository -- this time not focused on spam URLs -- that can receive submissions from anyone with an algorand wallet.

I had originally been preparing to use Reach.sh to implement my smart contract, but was struggling through their documentation and wasn't able to get a full grasp of what I needed to do.

Then on the day of the Hackathon, I learned about the algokit environment (beaker, algosdk), which I decided to change tracks to.

Because of this, I wasn't really prepared and had to write the whole thing in 2 days, but it was worth it at the end.
