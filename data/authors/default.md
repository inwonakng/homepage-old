I am a Ph.D student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, working under Professor Oshani Seneviratne.
I work mostly with Python for data/analysis oriented projects.
I am also familiar with javascript-based frameworks for web development.

During my undergraduate and master's program, I focused on explainable machine learning using shallow models -- i.e. decision trees.
My master's project was on collecting survey data from participants and building explainable ML models to try to explain the results.
During this time, I also dabbled in NLP and built an enhanced pipeline of existing state-of-art model for Preference Ellicitation task using GNNs and coreference parsers.

My PhD focus is on blockchain systems and integration of machine learning with blockchains.
