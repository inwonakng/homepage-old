This is an ongoing work I have been working on with Qishen Han and professor Lirong Xia.
In this work, we try to buid decision tree classifiers that can _perfectly_ learn a voting rule.
Using specific ranking-aware features, we were able to train decision tree models that are able represent WMG-based voting rules in a tree form.

This work has been accepted as an extended abstract for AAMAS 2023.
